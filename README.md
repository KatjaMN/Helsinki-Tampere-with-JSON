# Helsinki-Tampere-with-JSON
Course work (Digital Technologies), learning JSON &amp; Fetch API.

I used Bootstrap to add the navigation bar on top of the page. In some pages I used the grid system. The assignmetn was about learning to fetch data in JSON form, there fore much less attention was given to the visual output.
